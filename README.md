# Reinforcement Learning in Finance

## Description
CAIS++ Spring 2019 Project: Building an Agent to Trade with Reinforcement Learning

## Timeline
- February 3rd:
  - In meeting:
    - First Meeting, Environment Set-Up, DQN Explanation, Project Planning
  - Homework:
    - Read first three chapter of [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/)
    - Watch the first half of [Stanford RL Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvoHnicueoE&t=498s)
    - Code up your own LSTM on the AAPL data. Check each other's out for inspiration, find online resources, ask questions in the slack. Should be a useful exercise for everyone!
    - (Optional: Watch [LSTM Intro Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCUNPb-5EYI))
- February 10th: Working LSTM model
- February 17th: Working DQN
- February 24th: Working Actor-Critic Model
- March 3rd: Add details like trading costs, compute performance statistics, data visualization


## Long-Term To Do's
- Build back testing environment
- Integrate NLP sentiment analysis as feature
